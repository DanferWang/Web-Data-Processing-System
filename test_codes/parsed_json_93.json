back yard I m on vacation this week so I m posting some older articles Hope you enjoy this one You ever think about what is in your back yard Might seem like a bit of an odd question but it s one that s been on my mind recently It s really pretty easy for me to answer We ve got a fort for the kids to play on a slide and a little house for the younger ones some lawn furniture a grill and a small patio Seems pretty typical doesn t it Now if I just stopped there this would make for a pretty pointless and stupid post so I m not going to What s interesting to me are the things that I didn t describe that are back there things that I don t expect or want you to see We have a new dog that s still a bit of a puppy and she likes to drag things out the dog door and into the backyard She doesn t typically chew them up except for shoes she just takes them outside and deposits them between the fort and the back door One day my wife and I were talking while I was driving home from work and she said Don t look in the back yard when you get home Naturally I was curious why I was being restricted like this and she replied with Because it looks like a diaper bomb went off out there Apparently Maggie had found a trash can in the bedroom where we had been putting diapers and was taking them outside one by one Now you might be wondering why I m telling you about this and how it relates to my point You really need to be less like my son watching a movie constantly asking about what s going to happen and be more patient I m only 250 words into this When there is stuff strewn all over the back yard I hate going out there It s surrounded by a fence so nobody sees it and this removes just about any motivation I might have to clean it up I don t even like mowing out there Normally nobody knows about this except for my family and it s not a big deal However last week anyone driving by my house knew about my lack of back yard cleanliness After a couple days of strong winds and one good storm my already pathetic fence gave up on one side of the house and came crashing down I look outside during the storm and notice three fence panels on the ground and two more waving like fans at a football game who just realized the camera was turned their direction I was understandably disappointed that I would have to repair the fence but I was more disturbed that now people would be able to see into my back yard and the sorry state it was in Last weekend while I was rebuilding the fence I had plenty of time to think I started to realize that the way we maintain our house could really be a metaphor for our own lives I try to make sure that the front yard is fairly well kept always mowed and looking at least presentable The front yard is like my public life It s lived out in front of anyone who can see it and what goes on there isn t hidden in the least Any words I speak in public are out there for all to hear My back yard is a bit more guarded I try to keep what is going on back there private but it doesn t always work as evidenced by my fence falling in Just like that fence sometimes my guard is down and people see a bit more of what I m really like I might try to quickly build the fence back up but once someone sees that back yard of my personality they probably won t forget it especially if it contradicts what I normally do My point behind all this is that we need to be sure that what we display in the front yard of our lives our public face is consistent with how we live in the back yard of our life We expect privacy there but we should also understand that at any moment that privacy can be broken and all the things that we try to hide from public view will be displayed for all to see Luke 12 2 3 tells us Let us live our lives so that what is proclaimed from the housetops is our love for our Savior our dedication to living our lives for the calling He has given to us We are the light of the world shining like that city on a hill to make known His sacrifice for us not for our own glory but for His Pray that we do not let the hidden part of our lives become a hindrance to the spreading of His word Related Posts What happens when you fail Tebow

trying to be a good moral person is that you re constantly being pulled towards those things you know you shouldn t be involved in Temptation has a way of dragging you back onto the wide path when you ve been trying to walk the straight and narrow Sometimes though you make the choices yourself You see that someone else is letting slide what you think is wrong so you begin to think it s OK too It could be swearing movies drinking just about anything You start to feel pressure if you re the one that is different from everyone else and then you begin to conform to the ways of those around you The little things add up all the time First you decide to tell a little white lie so that you don t get in trouble You follow those with lies to cover up the original lie Years later you re telling your spouse that you ve been at the office all day when really you ve been at a bar all because it s become more natural to lie than to tell the truth Opening the door to any sin allows all sin to get a foothold in your life We ve got to battle back sin with the Holy Spirit actively engaging in the fight and not passively allowing the enemy to roll over us This is something that doesn t come natural to any of us it really is a struggle to do However the reward for fighting back the sin in our lives is eternal Imagine that a worker notices a problem with a dam holding back millions of gallons of water Below that dam is a quaint little town full of people going about their everyday lives If the worker notices a small leak in the dam should he fix the leak or should he just say Oh it s just a small leak it should be fine Those millions of gallons of water are now placing pressure on that small leak causing it to grow a little bigger with each passing day Gradually the leak turns into a gaping hole allowing more water to pass through causing some minor issues in the little town Still the worker says The dam is still standing that hole isn t causing much damage I ll ignore it Eventually the gaping hole gives way to an actual dam break Millions of gallons of water are rushing down the hill towards the little town destroying everything in its path The little town is destroyed all the people are injured or killed and the dam worker justifies it by saying The dam just broke Now let s talk about sin this way Maybe you ve allowed a little sin into your life but you don t want to deal with it because it s not a big deal Everyone has small issues right Your family doesn t know about it and everything looks normal However that sin is placing pressure on you and on the rest of your life wanting to allow more sin to come through Gradually that sin grows into something that you and your family notice but you don t really identify the cause of the problem You continue to justify it by saying that everyone is doing it it ll be OK It s not causing too many problems in your life so you just let it continue Finally the dam breaks You act out on your sin in a big way destroying your family your reputation and your relationship with God You might say I don t know what happened I wasn t myself it just happened This is what happens when we allow sin to erode our life Our familiarity with sin is unacceptable to God We cannot be friendly with sin and friendly with God at the same time Through prayer through devotion to Him God can give us the ability to overcome sin but we have to make the effort to do so We have to pursue God so that He can renew our minds Are there areas where you need to battle back sin in your life How can I pray for you Related

culture Writing 0 Comments Lessons learned from a week on vacation It s been quite a week We have one more night here at Walt Disney World then we are headed home I ll give you a bit of a preview for next week though There are a few things I ve noticed here that develop into great analogies for life lessons Anything from a large burly fellow with a pink Disney Princess backpack to using the bathroom at the dinner table to the lack of wisdom in crowds I think you ll enjoy these However today I d like to share with a you a few lessons that have been forcefully taught to me this week Some painful some really painful and some rather enjoyable I love that I ve been able to spend a week in a single hotel room with my wife and kids However I m going crazy spending a week in a single hotel room with my kids Bedtime is the absolute craziest time of day I don t know if it is the tired children the tired parents or the insanity of being in one room but little ones do not go to sleep well this way at least not ours Now this is a very first world problem and I know that I should be thankful that I m able to take trips like this with my children Don t misunderstand me because I am very thankful for that The simple fact remains that it is so far out of the ordinary for us as to be uncomfortable and even more tiring The second thing I ve learned is that you can tell how many days people have been here just by the look on their faces There is an unspoken I ve sat through It s A Small World so many times that i might just twist off at the next puppet I see look to some faces These are the people that are not hardcore Disney fans but came mostly for their children An aside you know what would make Small World so much better Bucket o softballs You ll have to create a queue that would stretch all the way across the park for it So many childhood doll nightmares erased in a hail of tossed balls It s a goldmine I expect my royalty checks to pour in soon Too many people come here with the expectation that they can accomplish everything at WDW in a week This is so far from the truth My wife and I have been coming here since 1996 and we ve still not seen or done it all The likelihood is pretty slim that it will happen too Too many things changing or disappearing to be able to conquer that mountain The one lasting memory I have from our trips to WDW is the sense of awe that my children feel Heck I feel it too Everything here is so much bigger so much more perfect than the real world Of course if it weren t that way we wouldn t be paying to visit If someone built a Computer Progeammer World I d have to be drugged to be taken in to it I don t want my real life I want a different reality That might be good sometimes but it definitely isn t a way to live Finally it appears to me that while they are here people become a clearer more exact picture of themselves due to the money and time spent and emotional and physical investment paid to be here Vacations especially big ones like WDW have a way of refining our personalities in a way that other experiences don t I ve seen adults act like complete children and complete jerks I ve seen children be perfect angels and ceaseless terrors and you should have seen everyone else s kids too I m sure that I exhibit some of this too We are who we are and exhaustion makes the pretensions go away All in all it s been a great time here I m anxious to start home and return to my own reality though Too many exciting things coming up in the next few weeks that I don t want to miss I hope you come back again next week for my Observations on the World series Related Posts Next year s modelFlummoxed a week in reviewWhat is bi vocational ministry What s in your back yard Where to go from herePowered by Contextual

and garlic bread and you have a delicious meal in a minimal amount of time 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts 1 pound I usually cut the chicken breasts in half or use chicken tenders 1 egg slightly beaten  c seasoned bread crumbs I use the Italian seasoned bread crumbs 2 tablespoons margarine probably more like 4 or 6 tablespoons 1 3 4 cups prego spaghetti sauce this is barely enough sauce so you might want to add another cup or so  cup shredded mozzarella 2 oz I don t know if I use 2 oz I just add as much as I think looks good 1 tablespoon grated parmesan  cup chopped fresh parsley Using palm of hand flatten chicken to even thickness Dip chicken in egg then in crumbs to coat In skillet over medium heat in hot margarine brown chicken on both sides Add Prego sauce Reduce heat Cover

Warehouse Shopping Cost Effective or Costly Believe It Or Not You Can Shred Chicken in your Kitchen Aid Posted on December 8 2011 by Patty G I ve talked about this before the miraculous discovery that my kitchen aid paddle attachment will shred chicken No more forks and aching hands Throw it in chop it up and you re done But just in case you don t believe me because it definitely sounds too good to be true here s the proof Boil the chicken Remove from pan and place on cutting board Cut chicken breasts into halves I don t know if you absolutely have to do this but I did Put the chicken in the kitchen aid bowl with the paddle attachment Process the chicken for about 45 seconds on low speed And there you have it beautifully shredded chicken in a fraction of the time it takes with two forks If I hadn t seen it with my own eyes I wouldn t have believed it I have a friend who has a stand up mixer that isn t a Kitchen Aid Her mixer has two beaters instead of one paddle She tried shredding her chicken with her mixer and it worked just fine So next time you need shredded chicken skip the forks and use your Kitchen Aid It s a miracle You might also like I Love My Kitchen Aid Shredded BBQ

Spices Posted on December 6 2011 by Patty G Can you imagine foods without any herbs or spices Not a pleasant thought at all Herbs and spices make our food taste delicious It s fun to experiment with different combinations and sometimes our experiments work and sometimes they don t So in order to increase our chances for success as we experiment I ve created a chart listing many of the common herbs and spices and how they can be used I also included at the end of the chart some other specialty spices I have in my collection and where you can get more information about them My personal favorite is Chef Paul Prudhomme s Herbal Pizza Pasta Magic I use this spice every time I make pizza In fact I sprinkle it on the dough and skip the sauce It s delicious My daughter and daughter in law use the spice in addition to their sauce However you use it it s awesome Now before you take a look at the chart here are a few interesting facts I discovered while I was doing research Did you know You can make your own seasoned salt using this recipe  cup salt 1 tablespoon celery salt 1 tablespoon garlic salt 1 tablespoon paprika 1 teaspoon onion powder 1 teaspoon dry mustard 1 teaspoon pepper Mix ingredients in a blender for 20 seconds store in a tightly covered container The difference between black pepper and white pepper is that black pepper is ground peppercorns the dried berries of the pepper vine and white pepper is ground from ripened berries of the pepper vine before they re dried but after the husks have been removed White pepper is slightly less spicy than black pepper It s used to season bland light colored foods such as eggs cream soups and sauces dishes which might not look so appetizing with specks of black pepper The difference between red pepper and paprika is that red pepper also called cayenne pepper is ground from dried chili peppers and is pungent and hot while paprika is ground from certain varieties of sweet red peppers and has a sweet flavor although it may be quite hot 1 teaspoon dried herbs from the can or jar 1 tablespoon fresh herbs Dried herbs have a stronger flavor if you crush them between your fingers before adding them to food Herbs and spices are not the same Herbs are leafy green plant parts used for flavoring or as a garnish Spices are dried seeds fruits roots barks or vegetative substances used in small amounts as food additives for flavor color or preservatives And as promised here s the chart Download This entry was posted in Cooking and tagged herbs spices Bookmark the permalink Organizing by Grouping 20 Minute Chicken

Refrigerator Cinnamon Rolls Swiss Steak Mozzarella Crock Pot Directions too Posted on December 10 2011 by Patty G This is a really good recipe one of my favorites but it does take a little time It s not hard the steak just has to cook for a while That being said I made this once in the crock pot and it turned out just as good I ll provide crock pot directions at the end in case you want to try it that way 2 pounds round steak 3 tbsp flour  cup margarine 1 can petite diced tomatoes 1 1 2 tsp salt 2 to 4 tsp basil leaves 1 8 tsp pepper  c chopped onions  c green pepper diced I use the whole green pepper 1 1 2 cups mozzarella shredded Cut meat in serving sized pieces Coat with flour In a large covered skillet melt the margarine and brown meat slowly on both sides Add tomatoes salt basil and pepper Cover and simmer one hour Add onions and green pepper Cook 30 more minutes or until meat is tender Top meat with cheese Heat until cheese melts Crock Pot Directions You can either brown the meat in the skillet or skip that step it s up to you Either way works I did not brown my meat in the skillet In my opinion that eliminates some of the benefit of the crock pot I just want to throw everything in and be done with it Grease your crock pot with pam Mix the tomatoes salt basil pepper onions and green pepper together Layer as follows  serving sized round steak pieces  tomato mixture spread evenly over meat Remaining steak pieces Remaining tomato mixture spread evenly over meat Cover and cook on low for 6 to 8 hours Serve with a bowl of mozzarella cheese to put on top of steak

Effective or Costly Posted on December 9 2011 by Elizabeth Warehouse shopping such as at Costco and Sam s can be a great way to save money but it can also lead to the destruction of a good grocery budget It all depends on how you shop there First let s look at the cost and benefits of a membership A membership to Sam s costs 40 or 100 per year depending on the type of membership you chose The Advantage membership is 40 and allows for 2 cardholders and the ability to purchase products in store and online The Advantage Plus is 100 and allows for 2 card holders extended shopping hours extra coupons and a percentage of savings on generic and name brand prescriptions Costo s membership ranges from 55 110 per year The Gold Star membership is 55 and allows for 2 card holders extra coupons mailed to you monthly and the ability to purchase in store and online The Executive Gold Star membership is 110 and allows for 2 card holders extra coupons in the mail and 2 cash back on all purchases throughout the year You will get a check at the end of the year for your percentage back If the total does not equal 55 you can take your check in and they will refund the difference Outside the normal expected goods at warehouses they also have excellent competitive prices on prescriptions tires contact lenses glasses and much more Throughout the year you can find excellent prices on toys books clothing Halloween costumes movies and CDs and specialty items Our family has a membership to Costco and we figured out that if we only bought milk there regularly we would pay for our membership 2 5x in a year with the amount we save And now I want to tell you the secret to saving at warehouses Are you listening very closely It s all about what you buy and knowing your prices Just because something is sold at a warehouse does NOT mean it s a better deal than your neighborhood grocery store You must look at the unit price to see if it s a better deal If you aren t familiar with that term unit price is figured by calculating the total price times the number of items the package contains I often pull out my calculator and check unit prices while I m at Costco to compare it to what I know the grocery store price is to see if it s a better deal Some people hesitate to shop at warehouses because the quantities are often so large If you have room in your pantry or freezer and your family will consume something in reasonable time then it might be well worth it Another way to get around the large quantity is going in with a friend to split the purchase My sister in law and I have shared huge packages of toilet paper fruit and other things to help us both with our budgets and storage space Bottom line when you re warehouse shopping go with a list and a set amount to spend and stick with it This week s challenge If you re a warehouse member try calculating this week to see if what you are buying is really a better deal than the grocery store If you aren t already a member ask a friend who is if you can accompany them Sometimes you can also get a guest pass for a day to test out a membership Other articles you might like Grocery Gateway Opening the Door to

December 12 2011 at 1 33 pm My parents have a costco membership They buy their gas there and my dad calculated they save 90 00 year just from gas I have a sam s mbrshp and I m not sure if we re saving as much as we could because I just don t like driving over there but I do try to buy milk there as often as I can Also produce is cheap and I only buy their butter Reply says December 13 2011 at 1 51 pm I hadn t thought about the gas savings but that is usually around 05 cents less per gallon all the time And you re right they have excellent produce Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email

sing with such a deep voice I cannot imagine how his fans reacted when he came for the showcase We are very happy to be able to bring him back for a full concert When one listens to Greyson s songs it is impossible to portray him as a teenager most of the lyrics show maturity of the human soul his voice is solid it is likely to be impossible for a boy his age to have experienced the stories behind all his lyrics but that is what makes him unique his ability to put his empathy into the words he sings with passion and he will emerge as a star with most potential We at Marygops are happy that we could bring such a talented young person Greyson for us to hold his concert here The showcase was a very successful one and I am sure the concert will be the same He not only mesmerized all the young girls but his talent really does appeal to ones that love music The concert will be filledwith surprises and I am positive it will be one of the best concerts you will see Peter Harjani Project and

Rhino worldnews msnbc msn com Don t worry everyone s favorite RINO Ron Paul is still doing just dandy but according to MSNBC a group of anti poaching conservationists in South Africa accidentally killed the real rhinoceros they were using to demonstrate how to protects rhinos from poachers The 20 year old rhino named Spencer was shot with a tranquilizer gun in front of a crowd of reporters by members of the Rhino Rescue Project who were documenting a process used to identify protected animals and deter poachers from killing them for their horns After he was tranquilized Spencer s horn was to be treated with a dye and an insecticide and a tracking device was going to be inserted as well Unfortunately Spencer never woke up The rhino had an unfortunate reaction to the anesthesia said Rhino Rescue Project spokeswoman Lorinda Hern Every time you dart a rhino you take a risk that the rhino might not wake up and unfortunately today was one of those days Maybe they could have just used life like sculptures A record 448 rhinos were killed by poachers last year in South Africa home to the greatest number of the animals Hern says she blames Spencer s death on those poachers It s sad for us it s the loss of another animal It s a death that I still chalk up to poaching Next time maybe they should take a page from zoo keepers and police at the Ueno Zoo in Tokyo and do all their homework on rhinos before messing with them Contact the author of this article or email tips gothamist com with further questions comments or tips By Ben Yakas in News on February 10 2012 10 27 AM

Gothamist sure knows how to shoehorn their politics into a story that has nothing to do with it And btw Ron Paul is one of the few republicans that isn t a RINO Shouldn t they be punished proportionately to poachers Poachers kill These people killed a death is a death and a college degree in science shouldn t make you immune to justice Go talk to a vet and ask him about the risks of sedation for any animal Then ask them if vets deserve to be prosecuted whenever a pet dies because of anesthesia Seriously No thanks I m good Is anyone else thinking what I m thinking Weekend at Spencer s You put the sunglasses on him and I ll move his legs around It s genius I think you mean Bernie s failsauce brah words but yes The Rhino s name was Spencer genius Touch It s a death that I still chalk up to poaching What They accidentally took the life of an innocent Rhino as part of an animal rights demonstration and then blamed poachers for the accident Maybe they need to rethink their strategy for getting their point across especially since it involves potentially lethal actions If you ve got a better idea let s hear it If the dosage was too high use the correct dosage If it was indeed an allergic reaction they re off the hook one life to save a thousand is pretty good odds You re getting as bad as felix Granted Gothamist screwed up the story by writing it up in the snarkiest most sensationalistic way possible but clearly the conservationists were following their standard routine Ian MacAllen got it right in his comment above They wouldn t need a tracking device on every rhino if there weren t poachers You re getting as bad as felix Hey man that was below the belt Now I admit I m not versed on the methods used to sedate and track rhinos but I do know that it is not unusual for animals to get tranquilized with the wrong dosage thereby killing the animal The spokesperson said that the Rhino had an unfortunate reaction to the anesthesia but how does she know this was the cause of death Did she conduct an autopsy Or is this just her assumption I suppose it s certainly possible that she s right but I didn t read anywhere in the article about how she confirmed this Innocent until proven guilty fine but let s see some tests before they re completely off the hook I m sure they knew what they were doing If you read the original MSNBC story rather than the garbage Yakas wrote they have veterinarians take care of the tranquilizers Do you really think any conservation group would be dumb enough to say Let s try something we re unfamiliar with and invite the press to watch it all Any vet even stateside will tell you knocking out an animal is always a risk That s why good vets will avoid general anesthesia if at all possible My vet once went into an X ray room to calm and hold my cat while the X ray was taken because she didn t want to risk using a sedative So is the horn up for grabs now People The Worst Yup the guy on the far left holding the rhino s ass looks WAY too happy He may not have known at that point and time that the rhino was in danger no I was just saying he looked WAY too happy he likes fat chicks wth is wrong with people you don t use them as props Kind of sounds like they were doing what they ordinarily do which is track Rhinos and make the horns less desirable but were doing it in front of the press to explain the process Spencer s horn was to be treated with a dye and an insecticide and a tracking device was going to be inserted as well blog comments powered by Disqus Previous Home send a tip Got

Komen VP Karen Handel Planned Parenthood Is A Gigantic Bully Brian Cashman s Alleged Stalker Claims He Knew About Yankees Steroid Abuse The single mother who was arrested last week and charged with harassing and stalking Yankees general manager Brian Cashman amidst her claims that she had been Cashman s mistress since last April has levied new charges against Cashman Louise Neathway who also goes by the last name Meanwell claimed to the Daily News that Cashman confided in her that he purposefully misled federal investigators about whether Yankees brass knew certain players used steroids Cashman s spokesman Chris Giglio vehemently denied the accusations These claims are complete and utter fiction the latest installment of a carefully concocted campaign of harassment now spewing from a jail cell by a person who is being held on serious criminal felony charges of harassment and extortion Giglio said Neathway has already sent an email to Ron Gardella chief investigator for the U S Attorney s Office for the Southern District of New York and FBI agent Brian Jacob advising them of her claims In that email she said she had specific details on dates and times that Cashman was aware of steroid use by players Neathway has been charged with grand larceny attempted grand larceny stalking and aggravated harassment Among other things Cashman s lawyers say the 36 year old British national was an unhinged con woman out to extort him bombarding him with text messages and calls during the past 10 months She allegedly tried to blackmail him into paying for a 15 000 medical treatment threatening to contact the press and his family if he didn t Cashman says he eventually caved and gave her 6 000 in different bank accounts before contacting police Manhattan prosecutors have now subpoenaed Cashman s bank records which Post sources say include evidence that he gave her as much as 20 000 to Neathway in order to determine whether she truly was extorting him for months or if they were legitimate gifts as part of an affair Neathway who has 13 orders of protection against her since 1998 has been characterized by her exes as ruthless intimidating and conniving Neathway claimed Cashman had gotten her pregnant but an ultrasound she emailed him was ultimately proven to be a fake and Neathway s mother said she was never pregnant and had lied about it in the past as well Former boyfriend David Sano told the Post he went through a very similar situation with her a decade ago their relationship started after she claimed she was pregnant after a one night stand and ended around the time she personally delivered a sex tape featuring Sano and his former schoolteacher girlfriend to the headmaster of the Christian school where the woman worked That s what Louise does Sano

start going up once it s impossible to get a table Maybe by a dollar or so he concedes Prinzano s partner Rob DeFlorio one of the men behind Mother says If we re doing our job you won t even notice

be unveiled in time for spring But the chef and owner behind an Italian empire in the East Village is forming a locally sourced meat co op in Albany scoping out a LIC warehouse to store his whole animals and dreams of Sauce becoming a commissary for other kitchenless locations in New York His glass paned butcher s room is also a demo kitchen The idea is that everything on our menu will have a

restaurant is only about raw materials so much you know Yeah Frank was saying how tough it was to get stuff like offal and brains because no one really wants it so most butchers just throw it away A benefit to using a whole animal as Sauce does is that he can choose to cut it however he wants and when the brains look good they go up on the specials board Yeah a few years my friend made calf heart

NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly The 43 year old former Marine told reporters he felt terrific as he returned to the Fox New York office on East 67th Street this morning and he was welcomed back warmly by his co host Rosanna Scotto So you re back Scotto observed turning to Kelly who made a short statement at the start of the broadcast that left out any specifics about his absence Here s video Rosanna it s great to see you Kelly said on air Folks thank you It was a tough couple of weeks obviously for a lot of people And I m very very grateful for all the support I had here at Fox Five the support from my family and friends those I care about and the viewers of course They ve been just great the people who watch the show and have weighed in through social media positive remarks Thank you very much The speech concluded with a smattering of applause from the newsroom And I m especially grateful to this woman sitting next to me Rosanna Scotto Kelly added Scotto then told Kelly they were going right back to where we left off to which Kelly replied I don t know about that I don t want to work too hard Today s Friday And speaking of social media Twitter user NewKingofMedia wrote Greg Kelly proves if an awful woman is lyin ur the semi famous white son of the Police Commissioner it will all be resolved very quickly Kelly also issued a statement last night saying I am thankful that the investigation established what I ve known all along that I am innocent of the allegations that were waged against me I am so blessed to have a wonderful family and friends whose support for me never wavered Ray Kelly has not commented publicly on the allegation but Mayor Bloomberg told reporters earlier this week that DA Cy Vance did exactly what he should do He right away called his best sex crime investigators put it on the case They concluded apparently according to the paper where Bloomberg read the news that there was no law broken no reason to bring charges on either side and dismissed the thing Now let s get back to focusing on things that take this city and this country forward Contact the author of this article or email tips gothamist com with further questions comments

she was pregnant and if she was there is no proof that it was Kelly who impregnated her She showed poor judgement from the start and showed that she is irresponsible and reckless First to cheat on her boyfriend then to have unprotected sex and finally to have sex in her boss s office All the actions of someone who doesn t respect any boundaries of normal behavior If she was capable of all of this then what else is she capable of I never thought much of Greg Kelly before this actually thought he was a bit of a buffoon But he handled this situation with a lot of grace and character and I respect that I have to say that I actually like him now and will likely pay more attention to his career Hopefully Kelly learned something going through this and is more careful moving forward letting people get to him like this It s a shame the DA didn t press charges against her her actions were beyond criminal The bottom line is that no man should have to have his named dragged through the mud because of some lying cheating reckless irresponsible girl she pulled a kelly kapoor i was raped Michael You cannot say I was raped and expect all of your problems to go away Kelly Not again Don t keep doing that Lol I heard we re happy to have you gone before he corrected himself Woke up too late caught the back end of the show to see Bronson Pinchot acting all spaced out Rape or no rape he had sex with

left off to which Kelly replied I don t know about that I don t want to rape too hard Today s Rapeday Dude the guy clearly didn t do it What are you talking about Read the facts of the case She was drunk and cheated and tried to double back on it Wrong She couldn t remember the sex act The police found her story to remain consistent and they did not think she was lying It is not clear at all that he didn t do it The only thing clear is that there wasn t enough evidence One of three things happened 1 She was blackout drunk NOT unconcious but in a state where she is not herslef at all and will not remember anything that happened the next day Several of my friends are like this and it s scary they seem concious they re not slurring their words or stumbling but they are beyond drunk and the next day they have zero recollection of conversations and events that took place If they had sex in this state it s probably not rape since she consented but you have to be pretyy drunk yourself or a real weirdo creep to go through it if you re the guy Of course they did JUST MEET so maybe he didn t even notice 2 She passed out and he had sex with her Obviously this is rape but if she didn t remember what happened i e she didn t even remember passing out and he didn t admit it you can t bring charges 3 She consented she remembered it she got busted for cheating and tried to deflect it by bringing charges She was blackout drunk NOT unconcious Wrong The bar tab was so low it was determined she only had a few drinks Also surveillance showed her walking not staggering drunk through her office building Finally what about the steamy sex messages back and forth between them both All it proves to me is she s a good liar This is out of every argument that s been used in this case by far the most ridiculous You have no idea how high this woman s tolerance for alcohol is I ve seen women get totally smashed off two beers You have no idea if she had a few drinks before she got to the bar You have no idea if other patrons at the bar bought Greg Kelly and his date some drinks A bar tab is seriously the most insubstantial piece of evidence and you are an idiot for thinking a low bar tab proves anything Also for the last fucking time these steamy sex messages are only evidenced by a tabloid s anonymous sources That s it that s all Yes we know they exchanged texts but the Post s anonymous sources are the only ones releasing the content You might as well tell me you take everything the National Enquirer says at face value too First of all she could have been drunk when she showed up at the bar or the bartender or another patron could have bought them shots Second and here is where my public service annoiuncment comes in I ve seen people get blackout drunk after two drinks It s really really weird They can walk straight and they re not slurring but you can tell something is completely off Sometimes they act or speak really irrationally You think you re having a conversation with a sober person but they don t make any sense It s pretty scary actually I ve seen the same thing with people who do get obviously drunk slurring stumbling etc where the next day they have no idea what happened for the last few hours of the night But the kind where they seem sober but are really totally wasted is weird Also we haven t seen the texts so we really don t know what they say The DA did not conclude that no law was broken nor that Greg Kelly was innocent Just that there was not enough evidence to prosecute Nice spin for your guy Bloomberg The DA had not enough if any evidence to bring charges which is the lowest bar to surpass and step one in prosecuting someone Getting a grand jury indictment is the next higher bar then proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is even higher Kelly is presumed innocent from the outset Even if he were brought to trial and found not guilty you d have to give him the presumption of innocence Not to mention that in this case not only was he not brought to trial nor a grand jury indictment not handed down nor sought but the DA didn t even bring any charges Linda Fairstein a former sex crimes prosecutor and expert said independently that she had not seen or heard anyone establish the elements of a sex crime having been committed Does that information help you to reassess your position Not the way this case was handled Especially with the former prosecuter Farstein chiming in when the investigation was ongoing Completely innappropriate Fix was in from the start The DA has no credibility Too many leaks and opinions on page 6 before the outcome was finalized Greg Kelly may think he is in the clear But there are too many people who see this as business as usual The combination of the son of the NYPD Commissioner a white man with an apparent sense of entitlement and a sham investigation is not something to be proud of Nice spin yourself He s innocent Throw her ass in jail More women should be pissed at this lying accuser for making it harder for true rape victims to come forward it will be harder for woman to come forward because of people like you and the New YORK POST who vilified her even before the investigation with those new leaks SHAME ON Cy Vance what a tool a political tool as well Same as the NYPD release the kid s police record after they shot him Same play book You can t leak what ain t there It s a shame that you can t see through the superficial veneer of the leaks if any to the inconvenient fact that there was information not favorable to the allegations to leak in the first place NO one is free of sin Treat all people equally a bad kid doesn t deserve to be executed by NYPD nor does a foolish woman deserve to be raped by a news anchor This attack on victims is

featured Ex Komen VP Karen Handel Planned Parenthood Is A Gigantic Bully Indian Point Flack Stoked About New Nukes In Georgia On Thursday the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved a license request for a new nuclear power plant to be built near Augusta Georgia It s the first new nuclear power plant to get a green light from the government since the Three Mile Island meltdown in 1979 Go Isotopes Now nuclear power enthusiasts are spinning this faster than an overheating centrifuge heralding the licensing as the dawn of a new era in nuclear energy Jim Steets a spokesman for the controversial Indian Point facility just north of New York City tells CBS 880 It s positive news for the industry and I think the benefits of nuclear power are clear It certainly makes his job easier for a day or two since the last time Indian Point was in the news the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was rejecting some of the power plant s fire safety procedures Governor Cuomo has said that Indian Point should close and the facility has been under increased scrutiny ever since an earthquake in Japan damaged the Fukishima nuclear reactor Indian Point sits at the intersection of two fault lines and has been branded the most vulnerable to an earthquake in the nation As for the Georgia plant it goes without saying that not everyone is as sanguine as Indian Point s spokesman Laura Haight at the New York Public Interest Research Group maintains that private financing is almost dead in the water for nuclear power plants It s too risky It s too expensive And Allison Fisher an energy expert for the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen called the Georgia plant a step in the wrong direction It is inexplicable that we ve chosen this moment in history to expand the use of a failed and dangerous

featured Ex Komen VP Karen Handel Planned Parenthood Is A Gigantic Bully Parents And Occupiers Gone Wild The Crazy Scene At Yesterday s School Closings Meeting The annual fight over school closures between the city parents teachers and now Occupiers returned in full force last night for a raucous crazy meeting at Brooklyn Tech More than 2 000 people showed up for an evening the Times describes as being like several meetings were going on at once all of them confused and cacophonous with sound spilling over from one group to the next In the end the Panel for Education Policy voted to close or partially close the 23 schools they announced in December And even without Cathie Black to kick around like last year the meeting wasn t the most orderly There are important proposals up for discussion current Schools Commissioner Walcott said If all the teachers union wants to do is bus in Occupy Wall Street protesters then we will just have to work around that And so they did Because in addition to the Teachers Union which had originally planned to hold a meeting in a nearby school a group calling themselves Occupy the Department of Education were also on hand to help foster an atmosphere that was more chaotic than usual There was a heavy police presence but the NYPD press office tells us there weren t any arrests In the end PEP which consists of Walcott and 13 members appointed by the mayor and borough presidents voted to close all the schools on the block as it has done every time it has convened And this was only the beginning The City is aiming to close 62 schools this year as part of Mayor Bloomberg s educational reform plans Amid the chanting parents teachers and students spoke to the Panel in the hopes of saving their schools I m angry and I m frustrated I am afraid for the future of my child s life one mother at the hearing said Although the panel voted to close the schools many of them will remain open for a few more years as they graduate their current classes and are replaced by smaller schools Since Bloomberg became mayor the city has opened 396 schools and closed 117 with some overlap Despite the crazy crowds last night s hearing actually broke tradition and didn t actually go on for very long After about two hours the 2 500 seat auditorium began to empty out as the Occupy members reacted to an unconfirmed report that the police were about to make arrests and parents and students gave up on trying to speak To get a sense of just what the event was like here s an intermittently blurry video with some good audio And finally here are the schools that will be phased out and closed Bronx Gateway School For Environmental Research and Technology Jane Addams High School For Academic Careers Samuel Gompers Career And

education education mayor bloomberg pep school closings Other Interesting Stories Comments rss I know a handful of NYC teachers and they are borderline retarded Yet they get paid 80K per year because salary isn t based on skill it is based on longevity which is why the unions exist Hey gothamist did it not occur to you that some folks associated with OccupyWallStreet are parents of NYC public school students and some may be NYC teachers They are not mutually exclusive Do you think the teacher s union had to bus occupiers in That was just b s coming from Walcott I don t get it Are the schools failing for a lack of resources and bad teachers or because most students in the school don t care to learn Any time a school s in trouble or underperforming it s probably the students and in turn is caused by their parenting ha ha guess you attended one of the failing schools Not to be the grammar police but 1 it should be any time a school is in trouble and 2 their parenting is correct you should learn to diagram sentences it s really helpful As yourself whose parenting your sentence infers the students are parenting themselves which I guess is a bit like self deportation or something Oh you re missing a comma I don t have any stake in this discussion and I usually don t correct people s grammar on the internet but I can t resist Your disastrous post is much worse than PeanutButter s You forget to capitalize the first letters of a couple of your sentences You misuse infer the word you mean is imply You have two comma splices in the sentence ending it s really helpful You use a comma in place of a period after self deportation or something And you are wrong that school s should be replaced with school is the apostrophe here signals a contraction not a possessive Seriously I didn t know whether to respond earnestly or laugh The infer imply error drives me up the freakin wall At best Harriet got me on the parenting which at worst is ambiguous as it could mean the students were self parenting but as any rational person could reason in that context meant the students received poor parenting Harriet meet pot and kettle That video actually makes me sea sick OWS Teachers Union Why even bother Does anything get accomplished at these meetings Why can t people figure out a way to establish order And in the end is it even worth it I mean it s a fait accompli right These hearings are a big charade for the media and to embarrass the Mayor We all know that the crypt keeper Shelly makes any and all education decisions based upon input from the UFT OCCUPY BAD SCHOOLSSo stupid Occupy anything is stupid Sow me solutions and we can start to effect change Who brings an air horn to a meeting like this A clown I think that s an image stabilizer making

is Crippling Gaming in UK News Feb 10th 2012 4 55 PM by Johanna Armstrong TIGA The Independent Game Developers Association has been fighting with the UK government over tax breaks for the gaming industry According to the New York Times Because video game makers straddle the lines between software development the entertainment industry and online retailing they can combine tax breaks in ways that companies like Netflix and Adobe cannot But this isn t the case in the UK meaning that many UK developers are emigrating heading to countries which provide those types of incentives Rocksteady designer Sefton Hill has described this as a talent drain for the UK gaming industry In an interview with CVG Hill was asked whether or not he thought the UK could be competitive with countries like the US with regard to gaming Hill responds that many of his friends have gone abroad to find work Places like Montreal are hot spots for development because they have incredible tax breaks Continue Reading Tweet King Arthur II Review Macro Management Simplified ReviewsPC Feb 10th 2012 4 30 PM by Pride St Clair I concede that some video games or even entire video game genres are simply too complex or difficult for certain players to appreciate Or perhaps some individuals simply dislike lengthy complicated experiences In some regards I have to admit that games can be major investment and if someone is unwilling to dip past the surface mechanics of a video game then they are entitled to their reservations In that sense I can rationalize the existence of a game like King Arthur II despite my dislike for games of its philosophy King Arthur II is obviously the sequel to King Arthur The Roleplaying Wargame a game unique in that it ties together multiple genres into a fairly well executed package King Arthur II adopts much of its predecessor s gameplay but also expands upon it slightly Still this is clearly not as profound a package as a Total War game and it shows through the game s presentation and gameplay Continue Reading Tweet Casual Fridays TAG Devil May Cry Features Feb 10th 2012 3 00 PM by staff Welcome to Casual Fridays where we kick back relax and take off our

The Last Guardian Still Doesn t Have a Release Date News Feb 10th 2012 2 05 PM by Johanna Armstrong In any argument about whether or not games can be art anything developed by Team Ico Ico Shadow of the Colossus must come up They are beautiful emotional games with a simple story and overwhelming depth It s for these reasons that their newest project the Last Guardian has been highly anticipated throughout the six years since the release of Shadow of the Colossus Fans still gush about the game and come up with buckets of fan art despite the fact that there haven t been any real public updates in three years and reports that director Fumito Ueda had left Sony However 1UP has thrown us a bone to chew on while we wait for the real prize as they interviewed Sony Worldwide Studios president Shuhei Yoshida about the Last Guardian First Yoshida wanted to stress that Ueda didn t leave Sony He isn t an employee but he is continuing to work on the Last Guardian as a contractor without any real changes to his presence on the team He still goes into the office every day working the longest hours Continue Reading Tweet Xbox 720 Rumored to Have Touchscreen Controller News Feb 10th 2012 1 00 PM by Ben Chapman As far as rumors go the suggestion that the new Xbox console will have a built in touchscreen like the Wii U is one of the least substantiated but we re hearing it again Last month GameSpot was discussing the likelihood of the controller prototype and now Xbox World magazine is reporting from their sources that this decision is more than just conjecture The report in XBW suggests that the controller design is hoping to look more akin to a handheld like the PS Vita rather than a sizable tablet controller like the Wii U The report describes the design as an HD screen surrounded by the traditional 360 buttons and sticks Continue Reading Tweet New Lollipop Chainsaw Trailer is Just in Time for Valentine s Day 01 News360PS3 Feb 10th 2012 12 48 PM by Lucas Smith If your significant other was bitten by a zombie what would you do Would you kill them and put them out of their misery Or would you cut off their head and use nonexistent technology to keep it alive Personally I would go with number two but that s just me Needless to say that is the route that Juliet takes in the new trailer for Suda 51 s upcoming acid trip Lollipop Chainsaw This trailer introduces the severed head that had been hooked to Juliet s rear in the previous trailer Apparently he used have a super hot bod before getting bit by a zombie Afterwards in a truly tear jerking act

10th 2012 12 36 PM by Zach Martin The Splatters by SpikySnail Games is as charming and unique as it is difficult to describe It s basically a physics driven puzzler where the goal is to fling sentient balls of paint around in an effort to drench and detonate bomb clusters After an initial hands on with the game at PAX last year the development team pretty much went dark not releasing any new info or footage of the game until now The latest dev diary Flipping Out details the game s flip mechanic a sort of time reversal maneuver that allows your Splatter to fly back in the direction from whence it came Careful timing is the key to using the flip successfully and looks to add yet another layer of nuance to an already heavily nuanced game The Splatters is heading for a tentative Spring release

the masters of indie gaming horror have dropped a hint about their next game supposedly a follow up to their 2010 hit Amnesia The Dark Descent The teaser site is nothing more than an image that says something is emerging but clicking on the image takes you to a Google Maps view of China A horror title set in possibly ancient China Sign me up Craig Pearson over at Rock Paper Shotgun did some digging and proved the site is indeed real and not the work of a troll trying to get people s hopes up What Frictional has up its sleeves is anyone s guess at this point but if the first Amnesia title was any indication the next game will certainly have gamers screaming in terror as Cthulhian tentacle monsters chase them through dark hallways Post a Comment Tweet New Call of Duty Confirmed 01 News

Features Jul 10th 2010 3 24 AM by Cody Musser Today is the deadline for your biggest campaign pitch all year and Murphy s Law is in full effect You need campaign documents you ve forgotten on your home desktop a projector that can display at 246 inches with a 2200 1 contrast ratio and a GPS that will inform you of the derailed train blocking the closest highway This is your life and without the right gadgets and electronics to make it through things like train wrecks go from blocking highways to being how you describe your very existence These days though the toughest part of getting the right gear is finding it amidst all the clutter and clamor Half of your search results aren t at the top of the list because they re the best product for you that s for sure There are seedy armies of desk jockeys cramming SEO into everything they write Half of the reviews you ll find by very very serious bloggers are five star ratings because they got buttered up by a P R rep and their latest plasma TV was free You d think you could trust Amazon but they re literally putting products in order by what makes them the most money not by what is most relevant to your search eReaders are a perfect example Naturally Amazon suggests the Kindle It s perfect for everyone Barnes and Noble will only tell you about the Nook It s perfect for everyone Apple is caught up with all things iPad It s perfect for everyone They can t all be perfect for you right Clearly one is more suited to your desires but how do you know if you re a Kinde or iPad person This doesn t even include the hundred other options that are overshadowed by all the marketing You might never even know their features That s where Pikimal enters the fray We re the Master Blaster to your Thunderdome Pikimal allows you to define the features and specs that you want need in a sexy new device Interested in the biggest television you can get for the lowest price Who isn t What about the biggest television with 3 HDMI connections that also streams web content and is light enough for your grandmother to carry We can give you those results that detailed as quickly as you can drag a simple slider from left to right It s not as quick as snapping your fingers or clicking your heels but it s probably as close as you re going to get Nothing comes between you and the products that best match your interests and there are no marketing middlemen deciding what sits at the top of the list So where exactly does Piki Geek fit in all this With knowledge of the Pikimal tool and the Pikis for all sorts of electronics we re the guys with a healthy or possibly unhealthy passion for technology and gadgetry From which tablet PC can best display Porntube to which eReader has the finest selection of classic literature graphic novels this is where you ll find the information we ve pulled from Pikimal on the best products and who should be stoked about them news on upcoming tech and an extra double shot of ridiculously caffeinated geeky passion to wash it all down Let s be clear we re not another set of guys reviewing the free Xbox 360s that Microsoft gives out at press conferences We re pulling from the hard unchangeable facts and product specs collected by the coding geniuses Pikimal which cut through the hype and other marketing techniques that can cloud your judgment There s nothing old school about the latest generation of electronics so why are we still searching for and buying products like it s 1998 Let s recap Reviews are biased Sorry Ebert Google s been ransacked by SEO E tailers are

Trademark 02 News Feb 10th 2012 9 52 AM by Lucas Smith Legal issues are pretty common in this industry and for the most part they re over miniscule things In this case that thing is the trademark of the acronym DOTA Blizzard recently filed a complaint against Valve in an attempt to gain control of DOTA and all related names DOTA or Defense of the Anicents began as a mod in Blizzard s popular RTS Warcraft 3 Valve became interested in making DOTA 2 after corresponding with Icefrog DOTA s original developer and inviting him to the Valve offices Soon after they filed a trademark for DOTA so that they could begin work on the sequel Meanwhile Blizzard is in the midst of creating a Blizzard DOTA for Starcraft 2 From the court documents Warcraft III s EULA clearly specifies that all underlying intellectual property rights in and to Warcraft III are owned by Blizzard All title ownership rights and intellectual property rights in and to the Program and any and all copies thereof including but not limited to any titles computer code themes objects characters character names stories dialog catch phrases locations concepts artwork animations sounds musical compositions audiovisual effects methods of operation moral rights any related documentation and applets incorporated into the Program are owned by Blizzard or its licensors What does everything think about this Do you think Blizzard has valid claims for the ownership of the title Or should it go to Valve and Icefrog Speak up in the comments Post a Comment Tweet Other Cool Stuff Blizzard DOTA to be Released on Blizzard Arcade for

pretty sure Valve laid claim to the Dota 2 name by using it as an acronym stripped of the acronymity thus making it a legitimate name that doesn t mean anything They said as much here http pc ign com

small business User Experience 14 Examples of The Persuasive Power of Color in Web Design Tweet Stephanie Hamilton October 3 2011 7 Comments To see the impact color has on the overall user experience of a website one need only strip away a hue to see how the visual flow is affected While color creates the mood and feel of the site by directing user attention to certain elements there are many ways to approach the use of color Hue value and saturation are all three integrated dimensions of color that when used properly can enhance the site s message just as well if not better than using flashy colors In this article we ll delve deeper into color psychology as it relates to web design and view examples of sites that used color persuasively in their branding efforts A quick intro to color For a primer on color one should refer to the color wheel as it presents a logically arranged sequence of pure hues I m sure you re familiar with the primaries red yellow and blue and secondaries green orange and purple which are formed by mixing the primaries Tertiary colors are comprised of the middle colors like yellow green and blue green They are created by mixing a primary color and a secondary color We often refer to the color wheel as it can be used to create harmonious color schemes leading to an effective visual experience The Power of Color The two most popular advertising color choices in America blue and red are frequently used on websites globally Blue connotes trustworthiness loyalty and sincerity and is most often a business favorite due to these attributes But blue isn t for everyone and the best method of determining the right color or colors for your brand or website is to first consider the target group you re trying to reach Colors have different meanings to various age groups cultures and nationalities They have the power to reach beyond just connotations and hold the viewer s attention communicate what the business is about and make a sale When you think of the impact color has on a particular audience it s easy to see why companies exert a lot of time and effort in choosing the right one 5 website elements affected by color 1 Text Links A common solution for drawing attention to monochromatic links is to give them a faint background to lift them off the page This technique is shown in the navigation for AppZapper The active link on the navigation for Font Explorer is styled differently than the rest giving the user a quick glimpse at where they are on the website 2 Navigation Bronto uses saturated colors to bring attention to its navigation This balance works well with the rest of the site which is more subdued yet takes up more screen real estate 3 Buttons Postbox uses red and blue on its call to action buttons These highly saturated and large buttons do a great job of drawing attention to the intended action the user should take to download or buy the software Compare how the less saturated button just below and to the right would fare if those buttons switched colors The complimentary color of blue is used on the call to action button on Live Resto to set it apart on the layout and add emphasis 4 Headings The minimal clean website for Billings makes use of vibrant blue headings for emphasis 5 List Items A Small Orange makes use of its brand colors in the list of recent news posts The color doesn t overwhelm as it s used sparingly with a white background to ease its vibrancy Color can affect readability If the text on your site is meant for scanning instead of reading it s okay to have gray text on a black background On the website for VersionsApp the monotony is broken up through highlighting and the use of splashes of color throughout the text Sometimes the best solution is to have dark text on a white background Readability is hardly a problem with this method When necessary you can incorporate color into quotes or bullet points as shown here for Crazy Egg Color can affect accessibility We should also think of color in terms of accessibility for color blind users After all these color deficiencies affect about 8 of males and 0 5 of females The great thing about designing for this niche is good design judgment is really all it takes For instance don t use colors with similar brightness values as the base of your website This causes the text to vibrate and can lead to watery eyes Also if you re going to use a change in background color to designate a hover state make sure it has enough contrast and is different in its relative brightness It s also a good idea to add another design element such as a stroke to a button when this hover is activated providing further contrast The call to action buttons on the website for Notify feature a contrasting outer glow stroke when the user hovers over them Such small details add contrast to the button Going Monochromatic We re past the era of web design where we have to use as many flashy colors as possible to grab the user s attention Thankfully we ve developed insight into how we can convey a message using shades of one color The use of monochromatic color in layouts is a common practice for designers who want to portray a balanced interface while focusing on the overall UX instead of merely coloring things up As you ll see by the following examples it s possible to create an engaging and informed layout by simply using one color The Invoice Machine uses a grayscale for the design of its invoicing software s website Blue the common color for links is used as a border around the buttons emphasizing their importance in relation to the rest of the site This makes the buttons stand out without resulting in a bubbly 3 D look Davroc Interiors creates a soothing visual experience on its website Hover over the photographs to reveal full color images that add a layer of interest to the minimal website Blue the universal link color is used in areas throughout the site to enhance the user experience Metelab also uses a monochromatic color scheme on its website Notice the use of saturation on the top right button Saturated colors are effective on buttons links alerts and system messages because they grab the user s attention It s important to use these colors sparingly as too many can slow the user down When used correctly saturation can be exciting and dynamic Gray is a common color used in web design these days because it doesn t compete with saturated and desaturated colors The absence of color on The Grid System site is a great opportunity to make use of white space and bold typography when necessary Such elements help create hierarchy by grouping elements together according to importance There may be millions of colors out there and as a designer my goal is to choose those that speak to my client s business and mission While some companies adopt color as a tool to enhance dynamism others are put off by it when used sporadically Through the examples I ve shown in this article I hope to strike a balance between these extremes one where color can be used in all its vibrancy but still be elegant and alternative approaches to the use of color such as the monochromatic color scheme Have you noticed a color trend that is not addressed in this article Let me know in the comments About the Author Stephanie Hamilton is freelance Graphic Designer

Steps To Turbo Charge Testimonials For a Lift in Web Conversions Tweet Russ Henneberry October 4 2011 3 Comments Why do you do what you do One of the ways we decide what to do is to find out what others are doing You know like when you re in a restaurant and you don t know what to order It s easy to say I ll have what he s having It s called social proof Social proof is one of Dr Robert Cialdini s five laws of influence And it s a powerful one Dr Cialdini reminds us that advertisers incessantly remind us that their products are the best selling or fastest growing to imply that others are doing it so why aren t you Bartenders salt their tip jar with a 10 bill to increase tips Sitcoms provide laugh tracks to activate our deep rooted instincts to do what others are doing in this case laughing On the web customer testimonials have proven to be a high impact method for increasing web conversions But all testimonials are not created equal Sure putting any authentic testimonial on your website is likely to lift conversions But if you apply the three tips below testimonials can provide a tremendous lift in web conversions Step 1 Gather testimonials that overcome sales objections Make a list of every reason a prospect would not purchase your product or service Now gather at least one testimonial that overcomes each objection For instance Jane sells website design services She often hears from customers that they don t want to rebuild their website because they aren t sure if they will ever recover the cost of redesigning A testimonial like this ought to do the trick I redesigned my website with Jane and recovered my money the first six months of having my new website Now it s all positive ROI It was the best investment I made this year And Jane also receives sales objections from prospects who think redesigning a web site will be too time intensive Gathering a testimonial like this one should calm their nerves Jane s website design process was so simple She was very considerate of my time and I came away with a professional new website with none of the hassle Every prospect that hasn t converted is held up by some objection The right testimonial will provide the social proof needed to convert the prospect Step 2 Place testimonials strategically Sure Jane could place the above testimonials on the home page Or in a rotating area in the sidebar header or footer But there is a better way Great marketers and sales people seem to know just the right time to say something They can anticipate the next question in the mind of the prospect The difficulty in writing good sales copy is anticipating the prospect s next question without being with them physically Put some thought into the placement of your testimonials If you do you ll likely find a strategic area to place each testimonial For instance on the sales page for Jane s website design services there will be or should be an area where Jane addresses the issue of price Some testing would be in order but for those without the time or the volume of traffic needed to test it would make sense to place this testimonial next to your discussion about pricing In general don t just place testimonials without thinking Take a minute to place the testimonial in a location where it has the best chance of overcoming the objection that is on the prospect s mind Step 3 Add meat not cheese to your testimonials Unfortunately we have grown skeptical of testimonials Too many scammers out there writing testimonials that range from clearly fake to slightly cheesy As a result testimonials have to have meat on their bones Consider adding the following to your testimonials to boost their credibility Head shot Full name Company name Title Website URL Blood type Of course I m kidding about the blood type but the point is that testimonials that provide more detail will convert better They re simply more believable For instance the testimonial written for Jane s website design services will be much more credible if it looked like this Jane s website design process was so simple She was very considerate of my time and I came away with a professional new website with none of the hassle Russ Henneberry Director of Marketing Acme Manufacturing http www acmemanufacturing com O Universal Donor How to effectively gather testimonials First don t be afraid to ask for testimonials A happy customer is usually willing to provide a testimonial for you After all you solved their problem Be ready to pop the question at any point throughout your relationship with a customer The best time to ask is when they praise you Customers will often say things like Wow Jane You really saved my life here I really appreciate you being so responsive on this problem My boss was breathing down my neck A logical follow up from Jane would be It was my pleasure I have really enjoyed working on this project Would you mind providing me a short testimonial for my marketing materials How can they say no to that Some customers don t go out of their way to compliment you but if you know they re happy with your services ask for the testimonial Phrase your requests for testimonials carefully And when you ask the way you phrase the question is critical Remember you re trying to address objections that prospects have while they re reading the sales copy on your website For example if Jane knows she needs a testimonial that will overcome the price objection on her website she could phrase the request for testimonial this way It was my pleasure I have really enjoyed working on this project Would you mind providing me a short testimonial for my marketing materials Perhaps you could answer this question Why do you think working with Jane on your website redesign was a good value for your business By phrasing the request for testimonial in this way you make it very likely that the customer will provide you with the testimonial you need to overcome the price objection Take advantage of these tips and provide the powerful social proof needed to increases conversions It s true All testimonials are not created equally About the Author Russ Hennebery writes speaks and executes on

design advice for small business Copy Writing The Sexiest Way to Make So Much Money It Scares You Tweet Demian Farnworth January 26 2012 6 Comments It starts with the copy Copy so irresistible that readers rush hot and heavy through your sales letter begging to do whatever it is you want them to do Buy donate or subscribe It doesn t matter They want to do it But not everyone can write sales letters like that Unless you know the three appeals that are behind every successful advertisement The good sales letters use at least one of these appeals The best use all three What are these three appeals Let s explore Sex Soft core Hard core No core Sex sells Men s Health knows this and makes a mint from creating products and sales letter that put the physical act and how to get better at more of it as a key motivator for sales The image above is from one of their products The Big Book of Sex They do an excellent job of segmenting their audience between men and women and then creating appeals that well appeal to each But using sex as an appeal isn t limited to the physical act Sex includes love friendship and affection This is what I mean by no core Love Panky is appealing to women who not only want to fall in true love with a man but make that same man fall in love with them What makes these appeals work so well is that they are native to what is being sold Bad uses of this appeal occur when you try to pump up sales with woman who strip while you talk about your web domain service Go Daddy anyone Greed It s in our bones That desire to live like the rich Jet set around the world Own boats as big as school buses Spill more sashimi than most people will eat in a lifetime The Rich Jerk successfully milked this appeal for years And it s what fuels the Motley Fool Greed is why magazines like Money and Fortune are popular While these magazines are straight forward about their goal getting rich it s less obvious in publications like Financial Times or Forbes But it s still there If you can show someone how to make six figures a year retire young or even horde hundreds of products through coupons then you are using the greed appeal correctly Fear Just like sex sells so does fear It could be a test crash dummy hitting a dash board at 60 miles per hour A group of teenagers piling up body bags outside of the headquarters of a cigarette manufacturer Or a life of poverty for your children after you die Fear appeals work on that sense of uncertainty we have This is why insurance and services like tax shelters that protect your money from the hands of the government and greedy lawyers are so effective For example look at the headline below from Stansberry Research At first blush it might not seem to be about fear but notice the phrase change your life There s the uncertainty I was talking about It s combined with the bad news of the U S debt downgrade to make an intriguing headline that could prove crucial if you decide to ignore Putting It All Together Using just one of these appeals in your sales letter will get you some good response Use two and you ll get even better All three that s a sales letter orgasm The headline Loud Sex Is a Billion Dollar Problem from Forbes combines fear and greed and sex effectively You ve got the sex greed Billion Dollar and the fear Problem This wouldn t make a great sales letter headline however You know why It s not clear that the problem impacts the reader or that he ll personally benefit if he reads the copy If you want to do that you d write Why the Loud Sex Problem Is Costing You a Billion Dollars Greed is behind the Publishing Clearing House s Sweepstakes and state lottery games Illinois took it a step further and hilariously wove fear into their greed appeal Let me close with a little secret out of all of the above appeals greed is the most powerful Meaning if you can appeal to people s greed you are going to write a better sales letter This is born out by my own experience and it s born out by copywriting veterans like John Caples Then again if you can write a sales letter appeal combining all three you just might be able to retire young in a radioactive safe bunker with Angelina Jolie Or Brad Pitt Your choice Your Turn By the way the title of this post is The Sexiest Way to Make So Much Money It Scares You Got any idea what that is My idea was simply to combine all three appeals together in a sales letter but I was wondering if anybody could come up with a real occupation or gimmick that combines all three Matching ponies to the person who shares the best idea

Tutorials How to Transfer A Blog From Blogger To WordPress org Tweet Joseph Putnam January 27 2012 6 Comments For a lot of bloggers self hosting with Wordpress org provides the most professional blogging platform available If you started out using Blogger and now need a professional presence there s a good chance that you re ready to switch to Wordpress org But the point of this article isn t to convince you to switch If you re trying to decide whether or not to switch there are better articles to read But if you have decided to switch this post will walk you through step by step how to quickly and easily transfer from Blogger to Wordpress org Step 1 Sign up for hosting The first step in transferring from Blogger to Wordpress org is to sign up for hosting If you haven t picked out a hosting company yet Blue Host offers low prices that are competitive with other popular Wordpress hosts and they re also reliable To top it off they provide excellent customer service and they re control panel is one of the easiest to use You can t go wrong by choosing Blue Host Another good choice is Host Gator They offer some of the best rates in the business and they re known for their excellent customer service Note If you haven t already purchased a domain name Blue Host also offers a free domain name when you set up your account Step 2 Install Wordpress on your hosting account After signing up for hosting the next step is to install Wordpress on your hosting account To do so first log into your hosting control panel Next find the Wordpress icon located underneath a heading such as Simplescripts Installation or Software Services The wording will be different for each hosting company and you can always start a live chat with customer support if you need help Once you find the icon follow the steps to install Wordpress Note If possible you ll want to install Wordpress as a temporary installment This will allow you to set up the site on a temporary site so you aren t making all of the changes live while your readers are watching Step 3 Import to Wordpress The next step is to import posts from Blogger to Wordpress To do so log into your temporary wordpress installment by going to http yourtemporarydomain com wp admin After logging in go to the left hand sidebar and click on Tools and then select Import Posts On the next page where you ll be asked which type of posts you d like to import choose the option titled Blogger You ll next be asked if you d like to install an importer for Blogger The answer is yes so click the red button to install the importer Then click to activate and install the plugin You ll now click to authorize Wordpress to access your Blogger account and then follow the steps to import posts from Blogger to Wordpress Step 4 Double check the content Now that the posts have been transferred you ll need to double check that all of the posts and comments transferred correctly You can do this by comparing the number of posts and comments in Wordpress to the number of posts and comments in Blogger You ll have at least one extra post and one extra page in Wordpress due to the fact that Wordpress automatically generates a welcome post and sample page when it s first installed You ll want to delete each of these posts and pages Note Sometimes not all of the posts or comments transfer correctly If this is the case there may or may or may not be an easy way to get all of the posts transferred You can contact Blogger or troubleshoot by searching on Google if these posts are critical for your blog In cases like this it s often easier to not worry about the lost posts and move on Step 5 Choose and configure a theme After making sure the content transferred correctly and is ready to go navigate to Appearance in the right hand sidebar of the Wordpress dashboard and select themes Then click Install Themes at the top of the page and follow the steps to install a new Wordpress theme You ll want to pick out a theme that you like and configure it to work the way you want it to After picking the right theme for your site you can take some time to configure it to look the way you want it to by installing plugins and widgets and adding pages You can even pay a designer for a custom theme if you re so inclined Step 6 Change the permalink structure in Wordpress The next step is to change the permalink structure in Wordpress The reason you have to do this is that Blogger does crazy things with their permalink structure In order to minimize the number of broken links you ll need to change the permalink structure in Wordpress to match the crazy setup in Blogger To do this click on Settings in the left hand sidebar of the Wordpress dashboard and then click permalinks Now click the radio button for custom structure To the right of the button copy and paste this year monthnum postname html The permalink structure in Wordpress will now match the structure on the old Blogger site This will cause most of the links to work properly and minimize the number of broken links Note This will minimize the number of broken links but it won t eliminate them entirely This is due to the fact that Blogger removes articles such as a an and the from urls for post titles and Wordpress does not Because of this a post with a title such as The Absolute Best Way to Start a Wordpress Blog will have a url that

January 30 2012 1 Comments The name Amazon com has become synonymous with eCommerce If you are reading this blog there is no doubt that you have ordered something from Amazon com from the comforts of your desktop or laptop computer Today it is only slightly less likely that you have ordered something from Amazon from your phone I m no exception Yesterday I ordered a pair of ear buds on my iPhone from Amazon in between the time my dental hygienist cleaned my teeth and the dentist came in to give me the verdict We asked our Crazy Egg Design and Marketing Experts to analyze the Amazon mobile website design Take a hard look yourself read through our opinions and if you are so inclined give us your analysis in the comments below Design aspects that Amazon s Mobile Homepage is doing well include 1 Using a simple one column structure as a list view for the interface Adding multi column structures for any small mobile device makes the entire real estate feel crammed and harder to use 2 Keeping things simple by introducing high level functions and options that are most important such as search cart wish list streamlined menus 3 Information for the product is minimal to start but if user is interested they can go to the next layout with more details Biggest mistake most people make is providing too much copy content on one screen especially for mobile 4 Option to use full site at the bottom Providing the user the option to choose experience is important 5 Graphics colors and overall aesthetics are clean and minimal which help performance and keep maintenance costs lower Cesar Keller Simple Flame The user experience for the Amazon Mobile site should be very simple make it as easy as possible for someone to find a product and complete a purchase This successfully achieves that and by focusing on the most popular product categories Books Kindle Movies and Electronics it can keep the navigation as intuitive as possible I m also really happy to see that they offer a clear link to the Amazon com full site It s amazing how many mobile sites don t do this Robin Cannon Shiny Toy Robots The Amazon mobile home page is a great example of a mobile optimized website It s easy to navigate and gives the user what they are looking for right away the amazon search bar The ad below the search bar for Amazon Apps doesn t appear to be an ad at all and is very likely the reason the user navigated to Amazon on their mobile device in the first place The mobile site seems easy to navigate since appears very similar to the regular website The cart is at the top always reminding you how many items you have so far and the search bar and department categories are easy to navigate as well Angela Jones Design By Ange la Amazon are usability experts Their website isn t the prettiest thing out there nor is their mobile site but they do an amazing job of getting users to the products they want I buy just about everything I own from Amazon and I do that not only because of pricing but because it can be easier to find it on Amazon than my local retail outlet Retailers are you listening Given how much attention Amazon pays to what users are doing on their site they most likely took their top categories and made them easily accessible The arrows on the buttons are great functional suggestions I can tell that if I push Books the page is going to slide down in an accordion effect and I can tell that if I push See All Departments I m going to head off to another screen This is very effective in letting the user know what s going to happen To the savvy user it lets you know what you can do with a spotty 3G 4G connection and what you may want to wait for a more stable connection to do I love how the account specific and sub categories are styled differently This style change lets me know that these choices are specific to me and or my account Finally the best part of all FULL SITE I can t tell you how many poor mobile sites I ve been to where the experience was so lacking I wanted to go to the full site You know what those poor mobile sites all have in common They don t let you go to the full site A to Amazon for giving me the freedom to choose Christopher Lee Christoper Lee Designs The site looks very clean and easy to use The theme matches the www amazon com theme and helps promote the website s branding The two containers blue and yellow have different styles The blue one has rounded corners and is smaller in width than the yellow one which has square corners It might be more consistent if they were both the same style unless they are supposed to be separated From the screenshot it is unclear as to whether the department list is used when a search is done as is the case on the www amazon com This is mainly due to having advertisement in between the search field and the department list The Cart and Wishlist links are duplicated once up the top and once down the bottom Given that mobile screen space is limited one set should be removed Sanj Sahayam Unique Imprints This is a very useful mobile page It has most of the features of the main site in a smaller format with quick links to get to the most popular items I would guess that Amazon has research or analytics telling them which categories are essential to show on this page so I trust their judgment I could nitpick some stuff like wasting so much height on the ad for the Kindle Fire ensuring that anyone on an iPhone will never see the menus without scrolling down first but I said I wouldn t nitpick so I ll stop Brian Schwartz Spoke Marketing The great thing about the Amazon Mobile home page design is the fact that it is a simple design that one can identify as Amazon just by the fonts and colors The use of the viewable space before you would have to scroll below the fold is great The subtle placement of deals below the logo is pretty sly plus having the button to promote the mobile app below the search bar is a great idea The end user may find it easier to download the app and have it readily available then have to navigate to Amazon each time through the phone s browser Joseph Kalinowski Content Marketing Institute The Amazon mobile home page does an impressive job of presenting their large and complex navigation into a scaled down intuitive menu The order and use of different colors for the primary and secondary menus helps provide visual clarity I like that they ve featured search and their mobile app at the top of the page since those are likely top actions for mobile users The blue primary accent color leaves orange opposite on the color wheel as the optimal CTA color which they implemented fairly well On the improvement note links on the page need an audit check for adequate text size and padding to ensure they re easily clickable Tip Your pinky nail can work as a handy mobile sizing spacing guide for links since it s mostly likely the size of the your index finger s pressable surface area Angie Schottmuller Search Engine Watch This is a very decent way to show the most popular navigation options I m sure that Amazon tested this pretty thoroughly before concluding what people would click on most The only thing I d like if I were to use that application is that the advertisement was further down underneath the departments It seems more intuitive to have them directly underneath the search box instead Naomi Niles ShiftFWD I think the Amazon homepage has struck an excellent balance between easy navigation to a lot of different places which is absolutely necessary given the complexity of the site and showcasing the product that they are currently trying to push currently the Kindle Fire The guideline that I d take away from this design is that first you want to put front and center in front of your audience whatever you want them to see and then immediately give them access to anything that they might be looking for Danny Iny Firepole Marketing First I think it is clear that getting the word out about Kindle Fire is a primary goal of Amazon s I like the way the product is featured with an image and a clear call to action without trying to say too much on the mobile home page If you want to know more click the Learn More link Secondly it is clear that it has been detected that I am using an iPhone to reach the mobile version of the website This has caused the mobile home page to display a call to action to download their iPhone applications Lastly the navigation is brilliantly organized which is no small feat for a company that sells the wide array of products that Amazon sells They list the most popular departments on the home page and then a link to See All Departments if you don t find what you are looking for This allows them to serve the majority of people without cluttering up the mobile interface with links Russ Henneberry Tiny Mighty Media We know that many of our readers are experts in design and marketing as well We would love to hear your critique of the Amazon Mobile Home Page in the comments 1 Comment Post a comment Tom February 1 2012 at 12 46 am I think the navigation is great And the color scheme is transcendent of their desktop version Amazon s branding is their usability digitally at least They are missing a huge oppertunity to harness that same gut feeling through their TV and print media Reply Post a Comment Cancel reply Name Email

boiled conversion optimization and design advice for small business Opinion GOP 2012 How The Primary Candidates Websites Stack Up Tweet Robin Cannon January 31 2012 0 Comments Engaging voters online is an increasingly important part of the electoral process The 2008 Presidential campaign saw Barack Obama and the Democratic Party rightly complimented for their effective use of web technology and social media As the Republican presidential primary campaign continues has the GOP learned some of those lessons How are the four remaining candidates portraying themselves online Mitt Romney Romney makes a big mistake immediately by hiding his main website behind a very mundane splash page The splash page is intended to encourage people to sign up for updates about the campaign and the need for any candidate to develop a strong user list is important But this call to action could easily have been incorporated into the main site right now the first experience anyone has visiting Romney s campaign site is a mediocre and unattractive extra step I m sure it s going to put off a lot of visitors Once you get past the splash page Romney has a pretty appealing site The layout is strong and makes really effective use of imagery Good use of white space gives a clean and professional look It s easy to find more about Romney and his stance on the issues as well as latest campaign news It s also the only site that provides really visible links to state specific information for all 50 states I like the very clear calls to action for the main social media services Facebook Twitter and Google options to share major stories are seamlessly integrated and there are separate options for engaging with the candidate directly on social media This suggests a clear understanding that there s a distinction between building social media followers and sharing content GRADE B Newt Gingrich Gingrich s site scores highly for usability but doesn t have a really strong visual impact It s well put together but very traditional in its layout and appearance Kind of like a very standard blog template and that means it looks dated Navigation is simple and there are very clear calls to action for anyone interested in getting involved with the campaign donating or buying campaign related merchandise Social media seems very much an afterthought surprising given that Gingrich has a massive Twitter following compared to any of the other candidates It also looks like some areas of the site aren t updated often enough As I write this there are still sections on helping Gingrich win in the Iowa caucus or New Hampshire primary both events that happened a couple of weeks ago GRADE C Ron Paul Ron Paul s the only candidate using WordPress for his campaign website all the other candidates use Drupal Initial engagement is strong I really like his donation thermometer with a real time count and the recent donor helps to suggest that the Paul campaign engages with individual people It makes for a powerful call to action for donations I was confused navigating around the site The two columns of articles on the front page one is an opinion based Paulitical Ticker the other is Ron Paul in the News aren t very well differentiated The navigation bar has too many options and the different sections of the site could be more clearly defined Social media integration is relatively low key and the site is generally more wordy than the others as indeed Paul is as a candidate I think it would benefit from a larger font size it s fallen into the 12 pixel trap that might look OK at first glance but isn t that well suited to easily browsing text GRADE B Rick Santorum I just don t like this website The layout is odd and looks very strange in larger windows it s like they ve tried to create a fluid width layout without really understanding the principle It s blocky a little ugly and has bad typography Add in a lack of any clear call to action and I m unsure what the site is trying to achieve Even the language is a little unusual with some sections written in the third person and some sections written in the first person It gives the feeling of a made by committee website that doesn t have any strong creative vision or sense of purpose Of all the primary candidate websites Santorum s is the one that looks the most amateurish The first time it took me a few moments to work out where the navigation was the site layout works in such a way as to completely draw the eye away from that menu GRADE D Conclusions It s clear that the leading GOP candidates have upped their game and understand the importance of a good website former candidates John Huntsman Rick Perry Herman Cain and Michelle Bachmann also have reasonably polished sites There s still a lot of room to improve None of the sites use any HTML 5 technology their SEO is basic and none of the design is particularly outstanding The GOP candidates may have taken some steps to improve their online presence

Twitter hashtag veteran bear with me for a moment We will get to some advanced stuff shortly For those that are new to Twitter hashtags let s start with the basics What are Twitter Hashtags Hashtags are a way of organizing Twitter Twitter users are able to sort tweets that contain a particular hashtag By viewing tweets that contain a hashtag we are able to have conversations about topics on Twitter For example any tweet with the webdesign hashtag added to it can be easily found using Twitter com or 3rd party tools like Hootsuite and Tweetdeck Adding a hashtag to a tweet allows it to go beyond your own network to as many people that are following that hashtag to see real time conversation about that topic You can see a hashtag in action by simply tweeting this post I used the hashtag WebDesign in the title so everyone who tweets it will get to use one right off the bat How to Use Twitter Hashtags Hashtags can be used in a variety of ways for different purposes Some useful ways to use them include the following Gain a Wider Audience for Your Message Add a hashtag to your tweets when relevant to get a wider audience for your update This way instead of just your followers seeing your latest tweet on web design you can add webdesign to your tweet to get anyone who is following that hashtag to see it as well Capitalize on Trending Topics Be on the lookout for trending topic hashtags and add them to your tweets when applicable Use the Trending topics on your Twitter homepage to see the latest If you are looking to target a local marketing click on the change link to see

something is popular Monitor Industry News Want to follow hashtags in your industry You can do it a few different ways You could search for the hashtag on Twitter and use the Save this search button to save it on your Twitter account But a better way to do it would be to use a Twitter management tool like HootSuite shown above Tweetdeck or similar These programs allow you to add a column to your dashboard with the hashtag and will automatically update the stream as new tweets come in In HootSuite you would click the Add Stream button then add webdesign as your search query under the Search tab In Tweetdeck you would click the Add Column button select Search as the column type and enter webdesign in the search box This is a great way to see the latest tweets on industry related hashtags You ll probably see everything from random quotes popular articles and even job listings Answer Questions on a Particular Topic Take the above tip on following industry hashtags one step further by following questions asked on a particular hashtag by using the search query webdesign filter links Setting this search up on Twitter HootSuite Tweetdeck or similar applications will allow you to see questions asked about a particular topic mostly without any links in the tweet Answer these questions to help build your authority in the web design industry Create Valuable Resources You can use sites like Paper li which will allow you to create newspapers around hashtags You can see this web design daily as an example Find the Top Products As a web designer you might be asked your opinion on using particular things such as blog platforms Use Topsy Analytics and enter the platforms mentioned by your client as hashtags to see the number of people talking about them The one talked about the

comments About the Author Kristi Hines is a freelance writer blogger and social media enthusiast Her blog Kikolani focuses on blog marketing including social networking strategies and blogging tips 5 Comments Post a comment Robin Cannon February 1 2012 at 7 59 am Cool overview Definitely find there are a lot of people out there who have a vague conception about what hashtags are but don t really know how to use them effectively You can find some great tweets leading to great resources by permanently or semi permanently following certain hashtags although I tend to find that I end up with too many Tweetdeck columns if I try and follow everything I want If you re aiming at an external audience be careful of the hashtags you re using Most particularly be aware of some of the acronyms that might be confusing Something like cms or ux are easily recognizable to people within a certain industry but perhaps you re trying to provide some resources to explain or introduce these topics if that s the cause then the audience might not be well targeted by the use of acronyms Question on the paper li I often get tagged as having contributed to these but I can t remember ever really getting any return traffic to my website or Twitter follows that are identifiably from that source Are there any statistics on whether paper li sites have any real audience on an individual basis It s an interesting aggregator service but certainly I tend to trust personally curated sites far more Reply Kristi Hines February 1 2012 at 11 04 am Hi Robin Good point on the acronym hashtags Do you use Google Analytics I see paper li and their competitors scoop it summify com in my Traffic Sources Referral Traffic section With paper li you can click on the link in your Referral Traffic to see which users papers have sent the most traffic and with the other two you can see which posts on your site got the most traffic from them Reply Keith Glantz February 4 2012 at 10 25 am Thanks for putting this together like Reply Tisha M Silvers February 6 2012 at 12 17 pm Thanks for the great blog post Most definitely going to share it with my connections Reply Pingback 15 Twitter Hashtags for
